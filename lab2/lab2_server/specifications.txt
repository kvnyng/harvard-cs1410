ALU Operations Specification
----------------------------

AND
- Performs a 32-bit bitwise AND between x and y.
- Result: z = x & y.

ADD
- Performs signed 32-bit addition of x and y.
- Result: z = x + y (implemented using gate-level adder, not '+' operator).
- Updates flags: equal, zero, and overflow.

SUB
- Performs signed 32-bit subtraction of y from x.
- Result: z = x - y (implemented using adder with two’s complement of y).
- Updates flags: equal, zero, and overflow.

SLT (Set Less Than)
- Sets z = 32’d1 if x < y (signed comparison), otherwise z = 32’d0.
- Implemented using subtraction and sign/overflow logic (no '<' or '>').

SRL (Shift Right Logical)
- Shifts x right by the number of positions given by the lowest 5 bits of y.
- Vacated bits are filled with 0.
- No built-in shift operators allowed.

SRA (Shift Right Arithmetic)
- Shifts x right by the number of positions given by the lowest 5 bits of y.
- Vacated bits are filled with the sign bit (x[31]).
- No built-in shift operators allowed.

SLL (Shift Left Logical)
- Shifts x left by the number of positions given by the lowest 5 bits of y.
- Vacated bits are filled with 0.
- No built-in shift operators allowed.

ADD (Carry-Lookahead Adder)
- Performs signed 32-bit addition of x and y using a hierarchical carry-lookahead adder.
- Replaces ripple-carry adder for performance.
- Updates flags: equal, zero, and overflow.

General Notes:
- Overflow flag is valid only for ADD and SUB.
- Equal and zero flags must be valid for all operations.
- Unimplemented operations must output z = 32’d0.
