# MIPS Processor Testing Methodology

The MIPS processor testing follows a bottom-up three-phase approach using SystemVerilog testbenches with Xilinx Vivado simulator (xsim). **Unit testing** verifies individual components (control unit FSM, multiplexers, sign extender, barrel shifter, and memory) in isolation. **Integration testing** validates component interactions through R-type instruction sequences with register dependencies. **System testing** executes complete benchmark programs (rtype_tests, b_test, c_test, dead_registers) loaded from `.mem` files, comparing final register states against expected outputs. The automated test infrastructure (`run_all_tests.sh`) compiles, simulates, extracts register values, normalizes hex/decimal formats, and validates results, with selective ignoring of registers affected by unimplemented instructions (LW, SW, BEQ, BNE, J). All test results are stored in `test_results/` with detailed logs and pass/fail reporting.
